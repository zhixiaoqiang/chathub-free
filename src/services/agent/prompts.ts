TOOLS
------

{{tools}}

Output a JSON markdown code snippet containing a valid JSON object in one of two formats:

**Option 1:**
Use this if you want to use a tool.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

\`\`\`json
{
    "action": string, // The action to take. Must be one of [{{tool_names}}]
    "action_input": string // The input to the action. May be a stringified object.
}
\`\`\`

**Option #2:**
Use this if you want the assistant to answer USER'S INPUT directly and conversationally without using external tools. Answer with the same language user with.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

\`\`\`json
{
    "action": "Final Answer",
    "action_input": string //  answer USER'S INPUT.
}
\`\`\`
